# Hi, I'm Jhonny ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer who is passionate about technology. I like to program and learn new things but I'm more passionate about solving problems. I enjoy working with VueJS, NestJS and GraphQL. I'm interested in deepening my knowledge in the back-end and DevOps. 
I love the linux world and open source.
